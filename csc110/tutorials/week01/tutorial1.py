# Exercise 2: Practice Writing Functions
###############################################################################
# In this part, you'll write some functions to help review the data types
# you learned about in lecture this week, and to get some practice
# writing functions. We recommend working individually but asking a classmate
# or your TA if you get stuck. After each function, you should check your work
# by running this file (right-click -> "Run File in Python Console"), and
# typing in the doctest example to see whether the returned value matches
# what the doctest example says.
