"""CSC110 Fall 2020 Prep 4: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains several function headers and descriptions.
Your task is to complete this module by doing the following for EACH function below:

1. Implement the function so that it does what its description claims.

You do *not* need to add new doctests or preconditions (and in fact
you should *not* add any preconditions!).

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment---this is a
good habit to get into early!
