"""CSC110 Fall 2021 Prep 11: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains the data class definitions that serve as the foundation
for our computational model of a food delivery system, as we discussed in this week's
prep reading.

Please read through this file carefully, and follow all instructions described below.
We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

@dataclass
class Restaurant:
    """A place that serves food.

    Attributes:
      - name: the name of the restaurant
      - address: the address of the restaurant
      - menu: the menu of the restaurant with the name of the dish mapping to
        the price
      - location: the location of the restaurant as (latitude, longitude)

    Representation Invariants:
      - self.name != ''
      - self.address != ''
      - all(self.menu[item] >= 0 for item in self.menu)
      - -90 <= self.location[0] <= 90
      - -180 <= self.location[1] <= 180

    Sample Usage:
    >>> mcdonalds = Restaurant(name='McDonalds', address='160 Spadina Ave',\
                               menu={'fries': 4.5}, location=(43.649, -79.397))

@dataclass
class Customer:
    """A person who orders food.

    TODO: complete this data class by adding the following:
        1. Two attributes called "name" (a str) and "location" (a tuple[float, float])
           representing the name and location (latitude, logitude) of this customer.
           Add both type annotations and descriptions in the docstring.
        2. Three representation invariants (translated into Python expressions):
            - The name is non-empty
            - The latitude is between -90 and 90, inclusive.
            - The longitude is between -180 and 180, inclusive.
            Remember to use "self." to refer to each attribute in a representation
            invariant! (Otherwise they won't be detected by PythonTA.)
        3. A doctest example under "Sample Usage" that creates a customer named
            'David' whose location is (44.649, -79.115), and assigns the object to
            a variable named "david".

    Instance Attributes:
        - name: the name of the customer
        - location: a tuple containing the latitude and longitude of the customer

    Representation Invariants:
        - self.name != ''
        - -90 <= self.location[0] <= 90
        - -180 <= self.location[1] <= 180

    Sample Usage:

    >>> david = Customer('David', (44.649, -79.115))
    >>> david.name

class Order:
    """A food order from a customer.

    Attributes:

      - food_items: a mapping from names of food to the quantity being ordered
      - start_time: the time the order was placed
      - courier: the courier assigned to this order (initially None)
      - end_time: the time the order was completed by the courier (initially None)

    TODO: add a NEW representation invariant below that states that every food item
          in this order is a key in this order's restaurant's menu.

    Representation Invariants:
      - self.food_items != {}
      - all(self.food_items[item] > 0 for item in self.food_items)
      - all(food in self.restaurant.menu.keys() for food in self.food_items.keys())

    Sample Usage:

          you made to the Customer data class.
